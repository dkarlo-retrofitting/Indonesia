Retrofitting Asia
Hi, I'm Karlo – Building Tools for Resilient Housing
I'm focused on **community-based, climate-resilient construction** across Indonesia and Asia. I work on open-source platforms and toolkits to support cooperative retrofitting, green housing, and participatory urban planning.


## What I Do

- **Retrofitting Toolkit** — Designs, BOQ templates, and manuals for resilient upgrades (ferrocement, modular units like RISHA)
-  **Platform Co-ops for Construction** — Digital platforms to support builders, engineers, and communities
- 📊 **Community Housing Data Commons** — Mapping and crowdsourced housing inventories
